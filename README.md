## Get Started

To run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S-hadowHeart/Morse-Code-Encryption-Decryption.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Morse-Code-Encryption-Decryption
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:10000](http://127.0.0.1:10000) to access the Morse Code Fun web app.

## Notes for developers

- Persistent encryption key: The app now persists a Fernet key to `fernet.key` in the project root (or uses the `FERNET_KEY` / `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable if provided). This ensures encrypted chat messages can be decrypted after the server restarts. If you want ephemeral keys, delete `fernet.key` before starting the server.

- Running quick smoke tests:

  1. Ensure the server is running on port 10000 (default):

     ```powershell
     python .\app.py
     ```

  2. In another shell, run the smoke tests:

     ```powershell
     python .\tests\test_smoke.py
     ```

  The smoke test will exercise `/code` and `/chat/create` and report simple pass/fail output.
